☕ Café Management System

A **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** based project that simulates a café management system.  
This project was developed as part of my **CSE 1115 (Object-Oriented Programming)** course at **Premier University**.

🚀 Features
- 📋 **Menu Management** – Add, display, and manage café items.  
- 💰 **Billing System** – Calculate total bills with itemized details.  
- 👤 **Customer Interaction** – Take customer orders dynamically.  
- 🔄 **OOP Concepts** – Implements classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  
- 🧩 **Modular Code** – Easy to extend and maintain.  

🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core & OOP principles)  
- **Object-Oriented Design**  
- **IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans / Eclipse** (any Java IDE)
